Import necessary libraries: Raspberry Pi package, AprilTag library
Initialize: Touchscreen, Camera, Ultrasonic Range Sensor, Motors
    Assign AprilTags to each aisle

When input is received from Touchscreen:
    Set target to Touchscreen output 
    (given as AprilTag ID associated with aisle)

While approaching target:
    Drive forward (run Motors)

    If AprilTag detected:
        Check orientation of robot relative to AprilTag:
            While not facing straight in X, Y, Z direction:
                Turn

        Check AprilTag ID:
            If ID equal to target:
                Stop moving forward; move into aisle
            If ID NOT equal to target:
                Keep moving forward

    While Ultrasonic Range Sensor detects object:
        Turn 3 degrees clockwise
